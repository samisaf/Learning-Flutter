## Notes
### Compile to WebAssembly
To compile a Flutter web application to WebAssembly (WASM), you need to switch to the master channel using the command flutter channel master, then build your app with the command `flutter build web --wasm`. This will generate the necessary files, including a .wasm file, in the `build/web_wasm` directory.
